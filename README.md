I am a dedicated and self-learning Data Analyst with a passion for deriving meaningful insights from complex data sets. My journey in the world of data has equipped me with the skills and knowledge to make data-driven decisions that lead to tangible business results.

From SQL and Python to Looker Studio and Tableau, I am well-versed in a variety of tools and programming languages commonly used in the data analytics environment. I am constantly researching new technologies to stay at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.

After acquiring a technical background, I shifted my focus to the mobile gaming industry, where my interest and curiosity are exceptionally high. As I continue to enhance my skills in mobile game analysis, I develope in projects and write articles.
